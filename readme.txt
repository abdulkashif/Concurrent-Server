The zip file contains Client.py and Server.py
Execute "Server.py" by giving port number as argument - Eg - python Server.py 4022
Now Execute "Client.py" in same or different machines and connect to the server using ip address and port numbers as arguments - Eg python Client.py localhost 4022
It takes the input file for each client created separately and sorts it line by line giving back the sorted array
